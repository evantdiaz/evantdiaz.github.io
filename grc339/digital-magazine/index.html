                        <p>
                            Backpacking through Europe is one of the most epic travel experiences you can have. The continent is culturally diverse, has a well-established backpacker trail, and is relatively easy to navigate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve backpacked through different parts of Europe on multiple occasions, each time on a different timeframe and budget. With all my first-hand experience, I’m here to spill the tea on how much backpacking Europe will cost depending on your expectations and comfort level.

                        <h3>Hostels? AirBnB? Hotels? Camping? It depends.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Finding affordable accommodation while traveling on a tight budget is hard, but not impossible. The fall after graduating college, I spent six weeks backpacking and couchsurfing in Europe. At one point I wanted to “splurge” on a hostel. I was shocked at the price — $70 for a bed in a dorm in Amsterdam? Despite their reputation, hostels aren’t always the most budget-friendly accommodations, especially in Europe. If you’re traveling as a part of a pair, an Airbnb or hotel can sometimes be the same price or cheaper.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, where should you stay while traveling on a budget? An Airbnb, hostel, hotel, or something else entirely? To help you figure it out, I calculated, then compared, average prices across ten cities. Read on to see how Airbnbs vs. hostels vs. hotels compare in terms of price and amenities.

                        <h3>Best Credit Cards for International Travel</h3>
                        <p>
                            It’s easier than you think to leverage your credit card rewards to snag award flights and upgrades using miles and points. That said, be sure to have your credit house in order before you start earning rewards because the interest rates and fees will outweigh what you earn in rewards on a monthly balance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The right card for you is based on your goals and circumstances. Always do the math for your personal spending and consider how you would use the benefits before applying for a new card.

                        <p>
                            I learned a key lesson – there’s a difference between planned versus spontaneous travel. I’m a bit of a control freak when it comes to travel. I need to know what is going on, what we are doing, and where we are going. Being like this means you are somewhat stressed when you head out on your trip, but you also know that you will get as much as possible out of your time there.

It offers ample opportunity for self-reflection and growth with the joy of boundless freedom. It can also be daunting, especially if you’ve never traveled solo before.

                        <h3>Why You Should Be Buying Insurance</h3>
                        <p>
                            Yet while traveling can be fun, it’s also important to leave home prepared. One of the key things to do before you leave for any trip (especially international travel) is to get travel insurance.
                            If you’ve never heard of travel insurance, don’t worry. Not too long ago, we hadn’t heard of it either. But now, we never leave home without it.
                            In this guide, we’ll take a look at what travel insurance is, why it’s so important, and our favorite companies for buying travel insurance.
