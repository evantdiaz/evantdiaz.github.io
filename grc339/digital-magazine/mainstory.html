               <h2>First Step to Become a One Bag Traveller</h2>
               <p>These days, there are so many backpacks out there that it can be confusing knowing how to pick the right one. </p>
               <p>There’s actually a science to knowing what the best travel backpack is — and how to pick it! When I first started traveling, I spent weeks picking out my first travel backpack. I tried on dozens, did hours of online research, and tested them in the store to get a feel for what they would be like.</p>
               <p>It was a time-consuming process. However, that research paid off though as my first backpack lasted me 8 years.</p>
               <p>In fact, the only reason I bought a new backpack was because an airline lost that bag. Otherwise, that backpack would still be around today.</p>
               <p>There are many travel backpacks in the world — and even more places where you can purchase one.</p>
               <p>How do you pick the best backpack for traveling?</p>
               <p>Today, I’m going to teach you how.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>I don’t get to say this often so I am going to relish this moment: the Aer Travel Backpack 2 is one of the best backpacks in its class that you will find anywhere.
               </p>
               <p>At $299 the Pakt Travel Backpack isn’t the cheapest backpack on the market. That said, Pakt’s ethos is all about sustainability and durability, choosing materials and designs that will last a long time. The pack is made from thick-threaded 900D recycled plastic (ePET) and is fully weather-resistant. Tip of the hat to Pakt for designing this product for the long haul.

               </figure>
               <p>
                  From its sleek exterior to the impressively organized interior sections, this Aer backpack has got everything one needs for general everyday use, weekend adventures, and minimalist international travel.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The three individual main compartments offer truly excellent organization options if you’re traveling with different kinds of stuff, IE a laptop, clothing, electronics, work supplies, notebooks, chargers, etc. Everything has its place, and I love that. Gone are the days of having to fit everything into one singular compartment.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If you are looking for a travel backpack in the 30-40 liter range to serve your adventure and work needs, look no further friends. Keen to join the One Bag Travel movement? The Aer Travel Pack 2 is an excellent way to break in, period.

                  <figcaption>The Osprey Farpoint 40 Travel Backpack has everything you want from the durability, carry, and hideaway harness system.</figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  If you’ve ever searched the internet for ‘best travel backpack’ or found yourself wandering around your local sporting or camping goods store, chances are you’ve come across the Osprey Farpoint series before. Being highly reviewed and widely available to try before you buy at stores is as good a reason as any to try this pack, but the Osprey Farpoint is so much more. After testing it for just over a year, we like to think we know it quite well!
               </p>
               <p>
                  This is a solid bag that I cannot recommend enough. I’ve always been a fan of Osprey products and their brand. Plus the fact that they have been in the business since 1974 says a lot about their bags, overall durability, and brand.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Before purchasing any of the Osprey bags, as mentioned, they have an app which you use to input your measurements so you can get a bag that fits you perfectly. The bags come in two sizes S/M and M/L.

                     <h3>How Much Should a Backpack Cost?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Backpack prices depend a lot on size, fabric, and brand. Most backpacks cost between $99–300 USD. The medium-sized store brands generally cost around $199 USD. Store brands are cheaper than big-name brands like North Face, Osprey, and Gregory.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        You should aim to spend between $100–250 USD on your a backpack.

                     <h3>Does Size Matter?</h3>
                     <p>
                        You want a backpack that is big enough to hold just a bit more than the stuff you are bringing and not more than that. If a backpack fits everything you want, has a bit of extra room, and feels comfortable, then you have found the perfect backpack size. Manufacturers also have suggested torso and waist sizes for each model they produce, but I’ve found that the best way to know if a backpack feels right is to simply try it on.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        It’s important to remember that the bigger your backpack is, the less likely it is that you’ll be able to carry it on the airplane. Additionally, since you can no longer bring liquids in containers larger than three ounces on airplanes if your bag has soap and liquids in it, you’ll be forced to check the bag. Most baggage sizes are 45 linear inches (22 x 14 x 9 in) or 115 centimeters (56 x 36 x 23 cm) including handles and wheels so if you get a backpack with those dimensions, you’ll be able to carry on. This is roughly 45L (depending on the brand and shape). If you want to fly carry-on only, aim for a 40-45L bag.
